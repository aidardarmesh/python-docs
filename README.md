# Python 3.7 [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

Python is easy to use interpreted language. Works on Windows, Linux or Mac OS

Python is extensible: if you know C language, it is easy to add new built-in function or 
module to the interpreter, either to perform operations at maximum speed or link to libraries 
that may only be available in binary form.

Python interpreter is usually installed into `/usr/local/bin/python3.7`. *Putting binary to `/usr/local/bin` make possible to run it form terminal*:

    python 3.7

`/usr/local/python` is also popular location

Second way to start Python interpreter is `python -c "command arg-s"` (analogous to shell). You can use single or double quotes.
