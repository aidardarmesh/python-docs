# Python 3.7 [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

Python is easy to use interpreted language. Works on Windows, Linux or Mac OS

Python is extensible: if you know C language, it is easy to add new built-in function or 
module to the interpreter, either to perform operations at maximum speed or link to libraries 
that may only be available in binary form.
